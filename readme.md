#NSapp
In this project we started learning `Angular` and `Angular Animate`.

With this we made an App that shows all of the locations of the NS trainstations.

These are recieved by using [JSON](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/nsapp/blob/master/data/trainstations.json).

With this data we filled a list and made it so that you could search through the list.

Wich could be seen in the [Index.html](https://github.com/bikerboyasd/nsapp/blob/master/index.html).
